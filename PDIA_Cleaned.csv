I have delayed publishing work in regionally relevant journals to dedicate time and energy toward work designed for higher impact research in national/international journals as I have been given fairly clear indications that the tenure evaluation process (in particular at levels higher than my own academic unit) values contributions to highly ranked/impact factor journals substantially more. My publication decision making process will likely shift to more heavily value the pertinence of the audience and to open access once I'm over the tenure hurdle. I feel that this situation could be improved if there were ways of communicating the impact of work (beyond typical journal metrics) that were accepted by those non-archaeologists in decision making roles in the academic world.

In Elsevier (JAS) it is very apparent. There is no impartial evaluation process based on academic quality and the importance of a given study for archaeological science, in this case. Biased selection of seemingly eye-catchy topics is preferred. 
Some editors are also unprepared to find suitable reviewers (waiting time over 8 months up to 2 years). E.g. Elsevier.
The only option for me- for example- is to publish in German journals which, in turn, have lower impact factors. Another option is to publish with Wiley or Taylor & Francis.

I am not sure what ""Journal Impact Factor"" means but interpret it as publishing in said journal will have a greater impact in field, on colleagues, etc. than some other journal.  I have not yet published in Open Access. I do not concern myself with ""personal relationships"" when it comes to publishing except in cases where I believe that the editor is unfairly biased against me (often for reasons I can't comprehend) as has been the case."

I did not list the best journals specific to my region above, but I would rank them somewhere in the lower half of the top ""importance"" list for the archaeology of my region. 
One additional key factor on where to submit is the ""fit"" between the themes and content of the article and the target journal. Matters like the desired balance of theory, method, and data, the allowable tables and figures (including whether color figures are printed), and the general ideological tenor of the journal are critical in choosing where to submit. I would rank this a number 2 or 3 in the list of factors."
