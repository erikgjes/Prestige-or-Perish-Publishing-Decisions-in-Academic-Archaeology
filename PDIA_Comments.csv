24,141,Male,30-39,USA,English,English,Assistant Professor,USA,USA,My opinions on this matter are fundamentally colored by my current position on the tenure track. I have delayed publishing work in regionally relevant journals to dedicate time and energy toward work designed for higher impact research in national/international journals as I have been given fairly clear indications that the tenure evaluation process (in particular at levels higher than my own academic unit) values contributions to highly ranked/impact factor journals substantially more. My publication decision making process will likely shift to more heavily value the pertinence of the audience and to open access once I'm over the tenure hurdle. I feel that this situation could be improved if there were ways of communicating the impact of work (beyond typical journal metrics) that were accepted by those non-archaeologists in decision making roles in the academic world.

438,221,Female,40-49,Poland,German,English,Post-Doc,Sweden,Sweden," In my opinion, some Anglophonic journals more often reject studies where Russian materials are involved.  In Elsevier (JAS) it is very apparent. There is no impartial evaluation process based on academic quality and the importance of a given study for archaeological science, in this case. Biased selection of seemingly eye-catchy topics is preferred. 
Some editors are also unprepared to find suitable reviewers (waiting time over 8 months up to 2 years). E.g. Elsevier.
The only option for me- for example- is to publish in German journals which, in turn, have lower impact factors. Another option is to publish with Wiley or Taylor & Francis.

One additional key factor on where to submit is the ""fit"" between the themes and content of the article and the target journal. Matters like the desired balance of theory, method, and data, the allowable tables and figures (including whether color figures are printed), and the general ideological tenor of the journal are critical in choosing where to submit.
